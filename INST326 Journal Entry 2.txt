This week's exercise was a lot more challenging than last week's. The class material we went over was similar to what we learned at the end of INST126. My way of using AI this week was to have it review my notes so it could give me a detailed review before I started the assignment. While doing this week's assignments, I had to ask Chat to better explain what the question was asking of me.
