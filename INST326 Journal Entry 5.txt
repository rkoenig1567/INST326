This week we had to do our Function Library project. AI was a big help for this assignment. I find the proffesor instructions to lack clarity in most of his assignments, including this one. So the first thing I did was I placed the instructions on Chat so it can clearly explain it to me. After that I used chat to help me write an outline of what my functions will be. A key prompt I used for this was, "read the assignment instructions and help me come up with the 15 functions. Write now I only want to do pseudocode so don't write programs." These instructions made clear outlines that my team used for our assignment.
