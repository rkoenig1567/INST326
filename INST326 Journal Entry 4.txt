Our discussion group this week worked on publishing our repository online using Github. I was in shock when I started to get technical difficulties using Github desktop over the most simple things. When ever I clicked on sign in online I would get an error code. So I used AI this week to help me fix this issue. It would give me multipke ways on how to fix the issue. It wasn't very succesful at first. After it's fifth attempt it figuered out how to fix the issue.
